# Litter
“Take a litter, leave a litter.”

Litter is a social network where users leave and collect anonymous media based on their location. While in any location a user can open Litter, choose to drop litter and leave something for a future user to discover. When in a location a previous user has dropped litter, a user can pick up and view what happened in that location at a particular time in the past.

In a world where we connect less and less with those around us and spend more time on our devices, Litter is an app to connect users to the world around them.

By having users anonymously leave media and randomly pick up that media based on their location, Litter creates a grab-bag of bits of different peoples lives a user can reflect on at different times.
