Litter
“Drop a piece of yourself on the ground”

Litter is a social network where users leave and collect anonymous media based on their location. While in any location a user can open Litter, choose to drop litter and leave something for a future user to discover. When in a location a previous user has dropped litter, a user can pick up and view what happened in that location at a particular time in the past.
